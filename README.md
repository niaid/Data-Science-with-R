# Data Science with R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to provide a series of course materials
that is used for online seminars to introduce modern data science
practice using the R language. Each subfolder in the respository
provides materials for a specific course in the seminar series.

Instructor: `Gabriel Rosenfeld`

Contact: `bioinformatics@niaid.nih.gov`

### Courses

-   **intro_programming_r**: provides the basics of using the R
    programming language for analysis and is suitable for those who are
    new to using the R language
-   **reproducible_workflows_r**: provides an introduction to using
    reproducible workflows with a data analysis project through the
    targets R package and is suitable for intermediate R users with
    familiarity to functions, project organization, and manipulating
    files
-   **reproducible_workflows_hpc**: provides an overview of using the
    targets reproducible workflow approach on the NIAID LOCUS
    High-Performance computing environment to scale up analyses and is
    suitable for intermediate/advanced R users with familiarity to
    functions, project organization, file manipulation, as well as
    understanding/access to an HPC environment
